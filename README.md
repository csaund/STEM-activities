## Live "Coding" A Robot 
An activity for kids age 6-10 with a broad range of coding experience (none -- Scratch). 
Children use a limited instruction set to "control" their friends (who are the "Robots.") 
They get the Robots to perform tasks like walk across the room, introduce themselves, and 
do a dance. 
### Stats:
Time: 45-90 Minutes
Age: 6-12
Materials: Very little; optional notecards
### CS principles: 
* Interfaces and Instructions
* Syntax (if you want to go that route)
* Functions and Parameterization
* Teamwork and Collaboration

## Python Arrays
** 100% of the credit to this goes to [Adam Piel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-piel-245a4471/), who is an utterly spectacular friend and teacher!**  
Excellent intro to python using arrays. Find any online python compiler/sandbox 
(I use [this](https://repl.it/@whearst3/Python-Sandbox)) and send them off. 
Great for kids without any coding experience or with experience only using 
scratch or another visual language
### Stats:
Time: 30 Minutes
Age: 10-14
Materials: 1 computer per student
### CS Principles:
* Coding basics
* Arrays and iterators
* Loops
