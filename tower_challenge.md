## POPSICLE STICK TOWERS

### Activity Overview

Groups of students compete to make the tallest tower. Themes include teamwork, iterative development, planning vs. experimenting.

### How to run it

Time: about 45 minutes

Materials:
* Popsicle sticks (~100 per team)
* Masking tape (not heavy duty)
* Measuring tapes

### Instructions
* Split students into groups of 4 or 5. Give them each a space to work in the same large room. VARIANT: Split students up in separate rooms.
* Give each team tape, a measuring tape, and popsicle sticks.
* Students have 45 minutes to try and make the tallest freestanding tower

Constraints:
* At no part of the tower’s base can it be wider than 1 foot. All parts of the base of the tower must fit inside a circle with a 1 foot diameter.
* The tower cannot hang anything from the ceiling.
* The tower must be freestanding.
* After 45 minutes, teams must take their hands away from the tower. Measure to find the winner.


### Retro Questions
* What did you like about this activity? What didn’t you like?
* Did you plan out a strategy beforehand? Or just start building and improvise?
* What would you differently next time?
* How would this challenge be different if you had to hold a can of Coke at the top of your tower?
* Did you take ideas from other teams? Is that cheating or not?
* Would you want to live in your tower? Do you think it’s sturdy?
* How do you think this is the same as what civil engineers go through when they build real towers? How do you think it’s different?
* If you were going to run this activity for your class at school, what would you change about it?


### Past Learnings
* Students tried to hang things from the ceiling.
* Students started with all kinds of ideas, then all moved towers one giant spire sticking up with pieces of tape for support.
