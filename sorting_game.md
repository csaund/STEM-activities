## SORTING NAME GAME

### Activity Overview

Students try to create a sorting algorithm which also learning each other’s names.


### How to run it

Time: 20-30 minutes

Materials: None

Instructions
* Break students into groups of 5-7
* One student becomes the “programmer,” while the others become “bits.”
* The bits get into a line shoulder to shoulder
* The programmer must put the bits into alphabetical order by first name by a series of swaps (he/she can tell two bits to swap places).
* Bits can only answer “yes” or “no” to questions (thumbs up thumbs down). They CANNOT say anything else.
* The programmer must keep track of his/her number of questions and number of swaps.
* Play several rounds with new programmers. You can do birthdates, last names, first names backwards.
* Whoever can sort his/her bits with the fewest questions/swaps can be the winner.
* Variant: The bits can talk to the programmer and help him/her strategize, but can’t give away any information about their name.


### Retro Questions
* What was the best question to ask?
* What is the best strategy? What would you tell a friend about to go to a “name game sorting” tournament?
* Was it hard to be a bit?
* Did you learn people’s names?
* What was the hardest part?
* Do some letter begin more common names than others? Does that affect how you ask questions?


### Past Learnings
* Some kids had a hard time sitting still while they were bits
* It can be hard to just sit there and wait, especially if the programmer is a little slower/ needs more time to think.
* Some students had a hard time making the leap to asking about groups of letters.
