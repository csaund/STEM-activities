# Problem 1.

# Congrats! Now arrays would not be that useful if we couldn't 
# put things into them. Watch this:

A = ["dog", "cat", "mouse"]

print(A)

# Okay, you printed your array! Now let's add something to our 
# array. Uncomment the next three lines (meaning just delete the 
# "#" at the beginning of the line), and choose a word to make
# the variable w equal. Remember to surround your word (we call 
# them strings) in "quotes."

# #Uncomment these lines........
# w = 
# A.append(w)
# print(A)
# #..............................


# Pretty cool, right! Now you can use A.append() to add to an array!
# Now we're going to try and iteratively (one after another) add
# even numbers from 0 to 20 to our array.

# Uncomment the below. It describes a "loop" which counts from 0 
# to 20. Every time we pass through the loop, the variable "i" is 
# the number we're on (0, 1, 2, 3...). The first thing we do is 
# use an "if" statement to check if i is even. If it IS EVEN, 
# we go to the next indented line.

# You need to fill in what goes on that line! Can you get the 
# program to print an array with even numbers under 20?

# #Uncomment these lines........
#B = []
#for i in range(20):
#	if i % 2 == 0:
#		# WHAT GOES HERE? #
#print(B)
# #..............................
