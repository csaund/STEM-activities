# Problem 3


# Consider the following sorted list

A = [4, 13, 19, 22, 23, 31, 35, 41, 50]

# Now let's say I wanted to insert a number in its
# proper spot.

x = 28

# First let's find out HOW LONG our array is...

length = len(A)

# This len() function is built into Python, and will tell us 
# how long our array A is.

for i in range(length):
	if A[i] > x:
		A.insert(i, x)
		break

print(A)

# Take a look at the above loop and try to understand what it's 
# doing. The "insert" function inserts 'x' at index numebr i.
# You can google "Python insert" if you want to learn more. 
# The work "break" makes the program exit the loop and stop
# looping.

# Try changing x above from 28 to another number and see what
# happens.

# Now uncomment the bellow. For every single number in J, insert 
# it into K at the right place so that K ends up as an in-order 
# list of all the numbers. You can copy and paste from above
# if you want to.


# #Uncomment these lines........
# J = [12, 34, 8, 3, 23, 11, 85, 20, 16, 99]
# K = [1, 5, 17, 21, 40, 55, 68, 101]

# for n in J:
# 	length_K = # What goes here?
# 	for # what goes here?
#		# and what about here?
#			# what on earth goes here?
#			# and what about here? Snake? Shake? Flake? 
		
# print(K)
