# Problem 2

# We can ask the computer IF something in in an array or not.
# Take a look:

A = [0, 1, 4, 7, 9]

for i in range(10):
	if i in A:
		print("Looks like " + str(i) + " is in our array!")
	else:
		print("Uh oh, " + str(i) + " is NOT in our array!")
		
# Here, like before, our "for" loop is counting from 1 to 9.
# On each pass, we say "if i in A", which asks "hey is this 
# number i (the number of the current pass through the loop)
# inside the array A? If it is, we print one message, if not 
# we print the other one. 

# I have three arrays. Two are full and one is empty. I want to 
# add to the empty one. I want to add every element (word) that 
# is on BOTH the other arrays. 

# #Uncomment these lines........
#X = ["gandalf", "aragorn", "bilbo", "gimli", "legolas", "pippin"]
#Y = ["frodo", "sam", "gandalf", "gollum", "bilbo", "pippin"]
#Z = []

#for elem in X:  # 
#	if # ask if the current element from X "elem" is also in Y
#		# if we got here than it IS. Add elem to Z.
#print(Z)
