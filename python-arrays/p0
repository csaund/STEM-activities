# Problem 0.

# Any line in a python program that starts with "#" is a "comment,"
# and will be ignored by the computer. If you deleted all of these 
# lines, the program would be the same (as far as the computer cares)!

# ARRAYS
# Arrays are like lists that the computer understands. They are
# a great way for us to store data that we will need later.
# Here I've named a new array "A" and given it five words that
# will be saved in order by our program.

A = ["adam", "is", "super", "awesome", "right?"]

# I can access pieces of data in the array using the name of the
# array and the POSITION NUMBER of the piece of data (the "element")
# that we want. Check it out:

print(A[0])
print(A[1])
print(A[2])

# Using this same pattern, see if you can print "awesome." Don't cheat!
# Don’t type the word “awesome” yourself!
